        <strong style="background-color: lightblue;">Electronic Health Records (EHRs)</strong>
        </br>
        EHRs have revolutionized patient data management by storing medical records digitally, which improves care
        coordination and efficiency. These records are accessible to multiple healthcare providers, ensuring that
        patients receive well-informed, consistent care, and reducing treatment errors. EHRs also streamline
        administrative tasks and enhance data security when encrypted properly.

        <strong style="background-color: lightblue;">Telemedicine</strong>
        </br>
        Telemedicine leverages digital platforms to facilitate remote consultations, making healthcare more accessible,
        especially for people in rural or underserved areas. Patients can connect with providers from home, reducing
        travel time and expanding access to healthcare.

        <strong style="background-color: lightblue;">AI-Powered Diagnostic</strong>
        </br>
        Artificial intelligence helps healthcare providers diagnose diseases with improved accuracy and speed. AI
        algorithms analyze medical imaging (such as MRI and CT scans) to detect patterns that may not be immediately
        visible to humans, leading to earlier detection and more personalized treatment plans.

    <p id="devices">
        <strong style="background-color: lightblue;">Wearable Devices and Remote Monitoring</strong>
        </br>
        IoT-enabled wearables like heart monitors and glucose trackers allow for continuous patient monitoring. These
        devices send real-time health data to providers, allowing them to intervene promptly when necessary, which is
        especially beneficial for managing chronic conditions.

    <p id="clinic">
        <strong style="background-color: lightblue;">Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)</strong>
        </br>
        CDSS tools provide evidence-based recommendations for healthcare providers by analyzing patient data and
        referencing the latest medical research. These systems support clinicians in making accurate treatment
        decisions, improving patient outcomes and reducing human error.
